**WIP Algorithm using Rust to sort 800+ incoming students into groups of 8 for FOOT Pre-Orientation Program**

Currently working on an algorithm that sorts incoming prefrosh into their orientation groups, assigning weights to hometown and backpacking preferences to create a diverse group.

Sorting students into groups is currently done solely by hand. I'm writing this algorithm in hopes of optimizing this annual process by reducing hundreds of hours of manual excel sheet movement.

To run the algorithm: ```cargo run > examples/**YOUR_FILE.csv**```

Output will be in outputs, with a timestamp available in the file name.

This is a personal project that is teaching me a lot more about Rust.
