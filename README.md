**WIP Algorithm using Rust/Python to sort 800+ incoming students into groups of 8 for FOOT Pre-Orientation Program**

EDIT: Implementing in Python for now.

Currently working on an algorithm that sorts incoming prefrosh into their orientation groups, assigning weights to hometown and backpacking preferences to create a diverse group.

Sorting students into groups is currently done solely by hand. I'm writing this algorithm in hopes of optimizing this annual process by reducing hundreds of hours of manual excel sheet movement.

To run the algorithm: ```python3 main.py > examples/**YOUR_FILE.csv**```

Output will be in outputs, with a timestamp available in the file name.

This is a personal project that is teaching me a lot more about Rust, however, I am writing in Python for now (and translating it to Rust later).

**PACKAGES NEEDED:**
